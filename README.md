# liver-disease-classification

This project was completed as part of the Machine Learning coursework for my Masters.

The Indian Liver Patient dataset from "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+%28Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset%29" was used for this study.

We were asked to select two supervised classification models and present the following for both - 
  a) supervised learning on training data
  b) optimization of hyper-parameters
  c) model evaluation including but not limited to confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 and AUC
  d) sensitivity analysis

kNN and Random Forest classifier were the two chosen models

Exploratory data analysis showed
  a) several highly skewed varaibles - Scikit learns PowerTransformer class was used within the model      pipelines to handle skewness in the data. 
  b) several highly correlated variables - dimensionality reduction and feature extraction was done        using PCA

Grid search was done on each model evaluation criteria â€“ accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and AUC. The training data was then fit to find the best hyperparameters for each. The predicted outputs and classification reports were generated using the best fit parameters. Lastly, confusion matrices and ROC plots for each of the optimized models were visualized. Sensitivity analysis was done for both models to show the performance with a small change in one of the hyperparameters.
